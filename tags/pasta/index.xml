The distributed nature of cloud applications, combined with their rapid deployment cycles and ephemeral infrastructure components, creates a complex threat landscape that must be analyzed systematically to identify potential security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
