In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to use AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) with TypeScript to create, manage, and deploy serverless applications with infrastructure that&amp;rsquo;s as maintainable and type-safe as your application code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-cdk-with-typescript">Why CDK with TypeScript?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>AWS CDK offers a compelling alternative to traditional infrastructure tools by allowing you to define cloud resources using familiar programming languages. When combined with TypeScript, CDK provides compile-time type checking, intelligent code completion, and the ability to create reusable, composable infrastructure components.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
