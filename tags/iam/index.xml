Zero-trust architecture operates on the principle that no entity—whether inside or outside the network perimeter—should be trusted by default. This paradigm shift represents a critical evolution in how we approach security design, particularly as organizations embrace distributed architectures, remote workforces, and multi-cloud strategies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In cloud-native applications, the concept of a network perimeter has largely dissolved. Services communicate across various networks, containers spin up and down dynamically, and data flows through multiple layers of infrastructure. Zero-trust provides a framework for securing these complex, distributed systems by treating every access request as potentially hostile and requiring explicit verification before granting access to any resource.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
