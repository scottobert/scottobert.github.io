&lt;p>While serverless architectures can significantly reduce operational costs, they require thoughtful design and configuration to maximize cost efficiency. This guide explores practical strategies for optimizing costs in AWS serverless applications, based on real-world experience and proven patterns.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="memory-and-duration-trade-offs">Memory and Duration Trade-offs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The relationship between Lambda memory allocation and execution duration isn&amp;rsquo;t always intuitive. Higher memory allocations often lead to faster execution times, potentially reducing overall costs. When right-sizing memory for your functions, start with the minimum required memory of 128MB and gradually increase while monitoring performance. In many cases, doubling the memory from 128MB to 256MB can cut execution time in half, resulting in lower overall costs despite the higher memory price.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Securing AWS Lambda Functions: Best Practices and Implementation Guide</title><link>https://scottobert.github.io/posts/securing-aws-lambda/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 13:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://scottobert.github.io/posts/securing-aws-lambda/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following our exploration of AWS Lambda with TypeScript and Step Functions, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand how to properly secure your serverless applications. Security in serverless architectures requires a different approach from traditional applications, as the infrastructure is managed by AWS while you maintain responsibility for securing your application logic and data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-the-shared-responsibility-model">Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the AWS Lambda context, the shared responsibility model takes on a unique form. AWS handles the security of the runtime environment, execution environment isolation, and underlying infrastructure. However, developers are responsible for securing their application code, managing IAM permissions, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring secure communication between services. This division of responsibility allows you to focus on application-specific security while AWS handles the infrastructure security.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
