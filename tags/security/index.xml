Security in serverless architectures requires a different approach from traditional applications, as the infrastructure is managed by AWS while you maintain responsibility for securing your application logic and data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="understanding-the-shared-responsibility-model">Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the AWS Lambda context, the shared responsibility model takes on a unique form. AWS handles the security of the runtime environment, execution environment isolation, and underlying infrastructure. However, developers are responsible for securing their application code, managing IAM permissions, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring secure communication between services. This division of responsibility allows you to focus on application-specific security while AWS handles the infrastructure security.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
