The traditional perimeter-based security model has given way to sophisticated identity and access management (IAM) patterns that embrace the distributed nature of cloud architectures. Understanding these patterns is crucial for building secure, scalable applications that can adapt to evolving security requirements while maintaining excellent user experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-evolution-of-identity-management">The Evolution of Identity Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud-native applications operate in environments where traditional network boundaries have dissolved. Users access applications from various devices and locations, while applications themselves consist of numerous microservices communicating across network boundaries. This distributed architecture demands identity management solutions that can provide consistent security policies across all components while maintaining the flexibility needed for modern development practices.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
