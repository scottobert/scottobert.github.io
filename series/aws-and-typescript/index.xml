In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to use AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) and SQS (Simple Queue Service) with TypeScript to create robust event-driven applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-event-driven-architecture">Why Event-Driven Architecture?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Event-driven architectures bring numerous advantages to modern cloud applications. At their core, they enable loose coupling between services, allowing components to evolve independently without affecting the entire system. This architectural approach naturally leads to improved scalability and resilience, as services can scale independently based on their specific load patterns. When traffic spikes occur, the system can better handle the increased load by buffering messages and processing them at an appropriate pace. The architecture also simplifies error handling and retry logic through built-in messaging capabilities, while the overall system becomes more maintainable due to clear boundaries between components.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Step Functions: Orchestrating AWS Lambda Workflows in TypeScript</title><link>https://scottobert.github.io/posts/aws-step-functions-typescript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://scottobert.github.io/posts/aws-step-functions-typescript/</guid><description>&lt;p>Building on our previous exploration of AWS Lambda with TypeScript, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into how Step Functions can orchestrate complex workflows across multiple Lambda functions. Step Functions provide a reliable way to coordinate distributed components and handle long-running processes in your serverless applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-step-functions">Why Step Functions?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While individual Lambda functions excel at discrete tasks, real-world applications demand more sophisticated orchestration capabilities. Applications typically need to manage complex workflows with multiple interconnected steps, implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic, and handle processes that extend beyond Lambda&amp;rsquo;s 15-minute execution limit. Additionally, maintaining state between steps and coordinating parallel task execution are common requirements in distributed systems. Step Functions address these challenges by providing a robust state machine-based orchestration service that brings structure and reliability to complex serverless workflows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to deploy an AWS Lambda function written in TypeScript using SAM CLI</title><link>https://scottobert.github.io/posts/aws-lambda-typescript/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 13:30:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://scottobert.github.io/posts/aws-lambda-typescript/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the world of AWS Serverless! In this blog post, we will be discussing how to deploy an AWS Lambda function written in TypeScript using the AWS SAM CLI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS Lambda is a compute service that allows you to run your code in response to events or triggers, such as changes to data in an S3 bucket, or updates to a DynamoDB table. AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. The SAM CLI provides a local development and testing environment for AWS Serverless applications.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
