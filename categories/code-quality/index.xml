&lt;p>In our Modern Development Practices series, we&amp;rsquo;ve explored test-driven development, code quality gates, API design patterns, microservices communication, database design, and performance testing. Today, we conclude with technical debt management â€“ the critical practice that determines whether your codebase remains maintainable and scalable as it grows.&lt;/p>
